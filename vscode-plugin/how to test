To test plugin and to see if commands have been registered in vs code follow these steps:

In terminal in vscode opened in the plugins directory run the following:
    npm install
    npm run compile
    code .

In this new window press F5.  Will open up another vscode window that now has the extension hopefully registered.

Press ctrl+shift+P and look for and run the plugin command.  Currently it's called "extension.generateCommitMessage"
